Introduction:

Starting from the version 0.5.6, QTerm supports scripts with QtScript. With
the greatest and latest script support in QTerm, you can:

1. Do boring and repeating operation automatically.
2. Change the default behavior of QTerm with system scripts.
3. Try new functions with script (In order to do this you might want to have
   Qt bindings for QtScript installed, they can be downloaded from
   http://labs.trolltech.com/page/Projects/QtScript/Generator)

================================================================================

How to Use:

You can run simple scripts using Script->Run, for example, save the following
code

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    QTerm.sendString("q");

to a script file, run it in QTerm will send 10 q's to the server.

To use the system control script. Open the address book, in the very end of
the General tab. First enable the Load Control Script checkbox, then choose
your system script.

================================================================================

How to Debug:

If you want to develop serious/complicate scripts for QTerm, it is very
helpful to have QScriptEngineDebugger enable. This feature is introduced in Qt
4.5, make sure your qt is new enough. Then you can run cmake with
-DQTERM_ENABLE_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER=ON, for example:

cmake .. -DQTERM_ENABLE_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER=ON

Then do the usual make, make install to install QTerm

After you enable the debugger. It will pop up every time the script engine
catches a exception. You can also call the debugger any time by Script->Debug.

How To Write a Script

Here is a list of functions you can call in the scripts, they are all in the
"QTerm" object, so for example if you want to call "version()" you should call
"QTerm.version()" instead.

QString version()
    Return the version of QTerm.

int caretX()
int caretY()
    Return the x or y coordinate of the current position of caret.

int columns()
int rows()
    Return the number of columns or rows of the current window.

int charX(int x, int y)
int charY(int x, int y)
    Given the graphical coordinate in the current window, convert it to the
    text coordinate.

int posX()
int posY()
    Return the x or y coordinate of the mouse.

QString getUrl()
QString getIP()
    Return the URL or IP address under the mouse pointer, if no url is
    detected an empty string will be returned.

bool isConnected()
    Check if the current window is conneced to a BBS server.

void reconnect()
    Reconnect to the BBS server, do nothing if the current window is already
    connected.
void disconnect()
    Disconnect from the current BBS server.

void buzz()
    Shake QTerm.

void sendString(const QString & string)
    Send string to the BBS server.

void sendParsedString(const QString & string)
    Send parsed string to the BBS server. you can use '^M' to represent the
    return key for example.

void showMessage(const QString & message, int icon = 1, int duration = 0)
    Show message in the osd, icon = 0, 1, 2, 3 means No/Info/Warning/Error
    icon. Duration is in the unit of ms, 0 means forever.

void cancelZmodem()
    Cancel the current zmodem transfer.

void setZmodemFileList(const QStringList & fileList)
    Set the list of files you want to upload with zmodem. call it before your
    start zmodem to avoid the file selection dialog.

QScriptValue getLine(int line)
    Get the object represent the 'line' line text.

QScriptValue window()
    Return the current window object.

bool addPopupMenu(QString id, QString menuTitle, QString icon = "QTerm")
    Add a menu item to the popup menu, you can access to the new action with
    QTerm.id property if the method succeed. menuTitle is the text displayed
    in the menu. currently icon parameter has no effect. Return true if
    succeed, otherwise it will return false.

bool addUrlMenu(QString id, QString menuTitle, QString icon = "QTerm")
    Add a menu item to the url popup menu, you can access to the new action
    with QTerm.id property if the method succeed. menuTitle is the text
    displayed in the menu. currently icon parameter has no effect. Return true
    if succeed, otherwise it will return false.

void addPopupSeparator()
void addUrlSeparator()
    Add separators to the popup/url menu so they will look nicer.

void loadScript(const QString & filename)
    Import external javascript files, QTerm will search the file under the
    "scripts" directory under the local path (e.g.SHOME/.qterm) first and then
    search the global path (e.g. /usr/share)

void globalPath()
    Return the global data path, for example, if you installed QTerm to /usr,
    then it will return /usr/share.

void localPath()
    Return the local data path, $HOME/.qterm under Linux.

QString getSelectedText(bool rect = false, bool color = false, const QString & escape = "")
    Return the current selected region. rect should always be false currently.
    color indicate if you want the copy the attribute of the text, escape is
    only useful when color is true, indicate how you want to represent the
    escape sequence.

void openUrl(const QString & url)
    Open the url using the http browser specified in QTerm.

void loadExtension(const QString & extension)
    Load extension, if you want to use the classes in Qt bindings, you
    need to load them first.

How to Write a System Script

In order to change the behavior of QTerm. You can reimplement the following
functions in the system script, again all the functions are members of 'QTerm'
object, for example init() should be understand as QTerm.init():

There is a property which is important for this usage: QTerm.accepted. It
should be set to true if you do not want the native QTerm code to handle the
event any further, otherwise it should set to false.

init()
    This function is called every time the system script is loaded. You can
    show messages or initiate some variables here.

setCursorType(x,y)
    Determine what kind of mouse cursor should be shown in the current
    context, if mouse release events is not handle by the script this function
    also determine how the mouse release will be handled.

setPageState()
    Determine the current state of the BBS page, useful for further determine
    the mouse behavior

setSelectRect(x,y)
    Determine if the text under mouse cursor is clickable, x and y is
    the mouse text coordinate. Return an 4-int array (x,y,w,h)

onMouseEvent(type, button, buttons, modifiers, pt_x, pt_y)
    Handle the mouse event, type, button, buttons, modifiers follow the
    definition in QMouseEvent, pt_x and pt_y is the graphical coordinate of the
    mouse pointer.

onKeyPressEvent(key, modifiers, text)
    Handle the key press event, the definition of the arguments again follows
    QKeyEvent.

onWheelEvent(delta, buttons, modifiers, orientation, pt_x, pt_y)
    Handle the mouse wheel event, the definition of delta, button, modifiers,
    and orientation follow QWheelEvent. pt_x and pt_y is the graphical
    coordinate of the mouse pointer.

onNewData()
    The function will be called every time QTerm gets new data, you can
    manipulate the received data a little bit.

antiIdle()
    Determine how the anti idle event should be handled.

autoReply()
    Determine how to reply the incoming message. Useful for those who want to
    write BBS robots.

checkUrl()
    Determine if there is a URL under the mouse pointer, return the URL if
    found, otherwise return a empty string.

checkIP()
    Determine if there is a IP address under the mouse pointer, return the URL
    if found, otherwise return a empty string.

onTelnetState(int state)
    Handle telnet events

onZmodemState(int type, int value, const QString& msg)
    Handle zmodem events

There is also a signal: scriptEvent(const QString& type) which can be used by
the script to emit and handle signals

================================================================================

Example Scripts:

There are several examples provided in the QTerm source code, you can use them
in you script or get a feeling about how the scripts can be used.

utils.js
    This script provides useful auxiliary functions to save a few keystrokes
    for you.
article.js
    This script provides basic article downloading functionality, note that
    the downloading operation is not well handled right now. Do this through
    the upcoming dbus interface might be a better idea.

highlight.js
    This script will highlight keywords your specified in the code if they are
    found in the current page.

console.js
    This script gives you a console to test different script functions. Steal
    from the great Amarok. You need qt bindings to run it.

websnap.js
    This script, modified from the code in graphics dojo
    (http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/graphics-dojo/trees/master/websnap),
    generates webpage snapshot. Currently it has troubles with webpage with
    frames, you are more than welcome to improve this if you are interested.

smth.js
    Sample system script for newsmth.net.

ptt.js
    Sample system script for ptt.cc.
